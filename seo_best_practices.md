# Expert SEO Best Practices for Webpage Creation

## ✅ 1. Keyword Strategy & Intent Mapping
- Deep keyword research using Ahrefs, SEMrush, or Google Keyword Planner.
- Target a primary keyword and 2–3 semantic/related keywords.
- Match search intent (informational, transactional, navigational).
- Use long-tail keywords for better conversion.
- Map your content to the buyer journey (Awareness → Consideration → Decision).

## ✅ 2. On-Page Optimization
- **Title Tag**: Include primary keyword early, keep under 60 characters.
- **Meta Description**: 150–160 characters, persuasive with keywords.
- **H1 Tag**: Only one per page, must contain your main keyword.
- **Subheadings (H2, H3)**: Structure content; include secondary keywords.
- **Image SEO**: Descriptive filenames + ALT text with relevant keywords.
- **Internal Linking**: Link to relevant internal pages using keyword-rich anchor text.
- **URL Structure**: Short, descriptive, keyword-rich (e.g., `/seo-best-practices`).

## ✅ 3. Content Quality
- Write unique, valuable, expert-level content (Google’s E-E-A-T principle).
- Minimum 800–1200 words for in-depth value.
- Include FAQ sections (can win rich snippets).
- Use bullet points, tables, bolding to improve readability.
- Avoid fluff; every sentence should deliver value or insight.

- Improve page speed (PageSpeed Insights or GTmetrix).
- Secure site with HTTPS.
- Add structured data (schema.org) for rich results.
- Fix broken links and duplicate content.

- Minimize intrusive popups.

## ✅ 6. Content Freshness & Authority
